# Odin_EtchaSketch

01/25/21 Hello everyone! This is my take on the EtchaSketch project. I completed this one in 3 days working somewhere around 4 hours a day. Will improve the code later on for this one, as I observed that it really looks like spaghetti code and I want to apply clean code practices in the future. Thank you and please try it out!
